# **Operators and Loops**

**Loops and Iteration**

1. Loops   *offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of  the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.

You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:

2. for statement
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

3. do...while statement
The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

4. while statement
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. 

5. labeled statement
A label provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program. For example, you can use a label to identify a loop, and then use the break or continue statements to indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution.

6. break statement
Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.

7. continue statement
The continue statement can be used to restart a while, do-while, for, or label statement.

8. for...in statement
The for...in statement iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object. For each distinct property, JavaScript executes the specified statements.

9. for...of statement
The for...of statement creates a loop Iterating over iterable objects (including Array, Map, Set, arguments object and so on), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.

# **Expressions and operators**

1. Operators
JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Arithmetic operators
Bitwise operators
Logical operators
String operators
Conditional (ternary) operator
Comma operator
Unary operators
Relational operators

2. Expressions
An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.
